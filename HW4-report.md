## Dataset 3

I have chosen to work with Dataset 3.  This dataset is called the Hottest Temperature of Record--Selected Cities.  This dataset gives information regarding the highest observed temperature for each month, within several different cities across the United States.  I chose this dataset, because of the recent California wild fires and the sub-zero weather in other parts of the United States.  I thought it would be interesting to look more into the data and discover some more patterns.

## Question 1
- Choose 5 cities and compare their record highs in each month. You may pick the 5 cities however you wish, but you must discuss how you chose the cities.\

- I picked the following 5 cities (Miami, Los Angeles, New York City, Washington D.C., and Detroit).  This is because I wanted to look at different cities across the United States in order to better understand the hottest temperatures.  I especially wanted to look at Los Angeles (due to the wildfires) and New York City (for its typical cold weather).

Idiom: Multiline Chart / Mark: Hue
| Data: Attribute | Data: Attribute Type  | Encode: Channel | 
| --- |---| --- |
| Months | ordered, categorical | outer horizontal spatial region (x-axis) |
| Temperature | value, quantitative | vertical position on a common scale (y-axis) |
| Station | categorical | color hue |

- The idiom is appropriate for this visualization, because of how it deals with temporal data, but also allows a good comparison between each city for the hottest temperature for each month.
