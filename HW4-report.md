## Dataset 3

I have chosen to work with Dataset 3.  This dataset is called the Hottest Temperature of Record--Selected Cities.  This dataset gives information regarding the highest observed temperature for each month, within several different cities across the United States.  I chose this dataset, because of the recent California wild fires and the sub-zero weather in other parts of the United States.  I thought it would be interesting to look more into the data and discover some more patterns.

## Question 1: Choose 5 cities and compare their record highs in each month. You may pick the 5 cities however you wish, but you must discuss how you chose the cities.
